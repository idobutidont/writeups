Well, that's new to me.\

The file looks like an ordinary executable, but however, after inspecting the strings, I found something interesting.\

Looking at the strings in the decompressed binary executable, I found this particular string:\
`Password correct, please see flag: 7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f31613561336633397d`\

After pasting the string in CyberChef, I discovered that it's actually hex.\
After converting it to ASCII, we have the flag: `picoCTF{U9X_UnP4ck1N6_B1n4Ri3S_1a5a3f39}`
